LiveData Migrator is a fully automated cloud migration solution that migrates HDFS data to the cloud, even while those data sets are under active change. LiveData Migrator is fully self-service requiring no WANdisco expertise. It is entirely non-intrusive and requires zero changes to applications, cluster, node configuration or operation. Migrations of any scale can begin immediately, and be performed while the source data is under active change without requiring any production system downtime or business disruption, and with zero risk of data loss.
