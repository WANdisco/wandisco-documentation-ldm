LiveData Migrator _migrates changing data_ at scale from HDFS to your choice of target environment, including the ongoing changes made to those data before, throughout and after migration. Targets include  [ADLS Gen 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction), [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage), [HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html), and [S3](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html) (including [IBM COS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage)).

LiveData Migrator can also migrate metadata between source and target metastores. Supported metastore types include [Apache Hive](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home), [AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/populate-data-catalog.html), and [Azure SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview). See the [Migrate metadata](./connect-metastores.md) section for instructions on how to use this feature.
