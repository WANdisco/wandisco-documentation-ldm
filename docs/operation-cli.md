title: Using LiveData Migrator with the Command Line
sidebar_label: CLI
---

This guide teaches you how to create and manage resources that control your migrations using the command line interface (CLI).

If you're new to the concept of LiveData, or want to know what LiveData Migrator does, see the [introduction to LiveData Migrator](./about.md) before learning [how to install](./installation.md) and use LiveData Migrator.

## Before you start

Configure management Access and use SSH to access the action prompt (you can access the CLI as any system user using SSH.)

Edit the SSH access properties in the `/etc/wandisco/livedata-migrator/application.properties` file to adjust to your requirements.

Refer to the [SSH access](./configuration.md#ssh-access) section for details about the required properties.

Restart the LiveData Migrator service to make any configuration changes live:

`service livedata-migrator restart`

### Default access

Without any change to configuration, you can login as the `user` user with the password `password` on port `2222`.

_Example_

```bash
$ ssh user@localhost -p 2222
Password authentication
Password: password
```

This starts LiveData Migrator and the action prompt appears.

### Use authorized SSH keys

Configure the LiveData Migrator service to use authorized SSH keys instead of a password by following these steps:

1. Comment out the `ssh.shell.password` configuration property so that password access is disabled.
1. Specify an authorized keys file with `ssh.shell.authorized-public-keys-file` to allow access from authorized clients that hold a matching private key.
1. Restart the LiveData Migrator service afterwards:  
   `service livedata-migrator restart`

## Using the LiveData Migrator jar (optional)

If you want to try out LiveData Migrator using a quick method, use the `livedata-migrator.jar`. This is an alternative to using the system service and it does not require configuration.

:::important
Use the system service instead for Production deployment as it allows you to maintain long-lived migrations, have a common configuration that survives service restarts, and retain logging information in a central directory.
:::

On the LiveData Migrator host, follow the steps below to run the jar:

1. Switch to the [HDFS superuser](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsPermissionsGuide.html#The_Super-User).  
   _Example_  
   `su - hdfs`
1. Change to the directory where the jar is located:  
   `cd /opt/wandisco/livedata-migrator`
1. Run the jar file to access the action prompt.

   * If Kerberos is disabled in your environment, run:  
     `java -jar livedata-migrator.jar`
   * If Kerberos is enabled in your environment, you must obtain a ticket before running the jar.  
     _Example_  
     `kinit -kt /etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.keytab hdfs@REALM.COM`  
     Afterwards, run:  
     `java -Dlm.kerberos.is.enabled=true -jar livedata-migrator.jar`

## How LiveData Migrator CLI resources work

Define three different resource types when using LiveData Migrator in the CLI.

**File systems**: Create and manage file system resources and define them as the source or target of migrations.

**Exclusions**: Constrain the content migrated by creating and referencing exclusion resources during a migration. Exclusion resources enforce constraints by file size or by a regular expression match against a file name.

**Migrations**: A migration resource references the source and target file system resources. Specify the source file system directory path for content to be migrated from, and include any exclusion resources as needed.

## LiveData Migrator command overview

There are five types of commands in LiveData Migrator:

* **Source**
* **File System**
* **Exclusion**
* **Migration**
* **Built-in**

You can find a summary of those commands here. Each section header links to the appropriate sub-section in the [LiveData Migrator Command Reference](./command-reference.md) page.

### Command line help

Find a full list of commands that can be used at the action prompt with the `help` command. Get command specific help by typing `help <command>` for each command available.

Use tab-completion to become familiar with the commands available and options that should be provided to them. Type the `<tab>` key if you are uncertain whether a command requires an additional parameter, or if you need to provide a specific value. It will help auto-complete parameter values, and display options available for any command.

## Migrate data

### [Source Commands](./command-reference.md#source-commands)

LiveData Migrator migrates data from a source file system.

:::note
The source file system is normally detected on startup. It will not be detected automatically if your Hadoop configuration does not contain the information needed to connect to the Hadoop file system.
:::

You can manage the source file system through these commands.

| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| [`source clear`](./command-reference.md#source-clear) | Delete all sources |
| [`source del`](./command-reference.md#source-del) | Delete a source |
| [`source fs show`](./command-reference.md#source-fs-show) | Show the source FileSystem configuration |

### [File System Commands](./command-reference.md#file-system-commands)

Create file system resources to provide LiveData Migrator with the information needed to read content from your source and migrate content to your target.

A range of different file system types are supported as targets, including [ADLS Gen 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction), [HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html), local file systems, and [S3A](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html).

:::note
LiveData Migrator currently supports HDFS file systems as a migration source.
:::

You can define multiple target file systems, and have migrations operating at the same time to them.

| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| [`filesystem add adls2 sharedKey`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-add-adls2-sharedkey) | Add an ADLS Gen 2 file system resource |
| [`filesystem add hdfs`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-add-hdfs) | Add a Hadoop HDFS file system resource |
| [`filesystem add local`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-add-local) | Add a local file system resource |
| [`filesystem add s3a`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-add-s3a) | Add an S3 file system resource |
| [`filesystem clear`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-clear) | Delete all target file systems |
| [`filesystem del`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-del) | Delete a target file system |
| [`filesystem list`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-list) | List of target file systems |
| [`filesystem show`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-show) | Get target file system details |
| [`filesystem types`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-types) | List the types of target file systems available |

If it was not discovered automatically or you wish to assign a new source file system, use the `--source` parameter on the [`filesystem add hdfs`](./command-reference.md#filesystem-add-hdfs) command to create a suitable HDFS source file system.

### [Exclusion Commands](./command-reference.md#exclusion-commands)

Define exclusion resources to constrain the content migrated from a source file system.

Exclusions need to be associated with migrations. You can do this when you create a migration resource, or associate exclusions with an existing migration.

| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| [`exclusion add file-size`](./command-reference.md#exclusion-add-file-size) | Create a new file size rule |
| [`exclusion add regex`](./command-reference.md#exclusion-add-regex) | Create a new regex exclusion rule |
| [`exclusion del`](./command-reference.md#exclusion-del) | Delete an exclusion rule |
| [`exclusion list`](./command-reference.md#exclusion-list) | List all exclusion rules |
| [`exclusion show`](./command-reference.md#exclusion-show) | Get details for a particular exclusion rule |

Adding exclusions to a new migration ensures the outcome is consistent with the chosen exclusions. Adding exclusions to an existing migration will change the future actions performed for that migration, but will not affect previously migrated content.

### [Migration Commands](./command-reference.md#migration-commands)

Create migration resources to define and initiate data migration.

Migration occurs from your source file system to a target defined using a `filesystem` command. Migrations will transfer existing data, as well as any subsequent changes made to the source data (in its scope), while LiveData Migrator remains in operation.

You will typically create multiple migrations so that you can select specific content from your source file system by path/directory. It is also possible to migrate to multiple independent file systems at the same time by defining multiple migration resources.

| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| [`migration abort`](./command-reference.md#migration-abort) | Abort a migration |
| [`migration del`](./command-reference.md#migration-del) | Delete a migration |
| [`migration exclusion add`](./command-reference.md#migration-exclusion-add) | Add an exclusion to a migration |
| [`migration exclusion del`](./command-reference.md#migration-exclusion-del) | Remove an exclusion from a migration |
| [`migration list`](./command-reference.md#migration-list) | List running and active migrations |
| [`migration new`](./command-reference.md#migration-new) | Create a new migration |
| [`migration run`](./command-reference.md#migration-run) | Start or resume a migration |
| [`migration show`](./command-reference.md#migration-show) | Get migration details |
| [`status`](./command-reference.md#status) | Get migration status |

#### Migration states

Migrations exist in one of eight states:

`NONSCHEDULED`
: A *non-scheduled migration* has been defined but not yet started. Create a migration in this state by not specifying the `--auto-start` parameter on creation.

`SCHEDULED`
: A *scheduled* migration will start when directed to run.

`STARTING`
: A *starting* migration is being started and will soon begin transferring content to the target.

`RUNNING`
: A *running* migration is scanning through source content and transferring content to the target, as well as responding to change notifications from the source if applicable.

`LIVE`
: A *live* migration has completed scanning through source content, continues to respond to change notifications from the source, and will transfer content to and make changes in the target as required.

`PAUSING`
: A *pausing* migration has been instructed to pause transfer, but is temporarily continuing to make changes to the target.

`PAUSED`
: A *paused* migration has been instructed to pause transfer, and is not transferring content or making other changes to the target.

`ABORTED`
: An *aborted* migration will not make any changes to the target and cannot be run again.

## [Built-In Commands](./command-reference.md#built-in-commands)

The built-in commands are always available in a LiveData Migrator command line interactive session. They are unrelated to migration resources and operation (other than `exit`/`quit`), but help you to interact with LiveData Migrator and automate processing through scripts for the action prompt.

| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| [`clear`](./command-reference.md#clear) | Clear the shell screen |
| [`exit`](./command-reference.md#exit)/[`quit`](./command-reference.md#exit) | Exit the interactive session with the action prompt, and stop LiveData Migrator if not running as a system service. You can also exit the session with `<Ctrl-D>`. |
| [`help`](./command-reference.md#help) | Display help about available commands |
| [`history`](./command-reference.md#history) | Display or save the history of previously run commands |
| [`script`](./command-reference.md#script) | Read and execute commands from a file |
| [`stacktrace`](./command-reference.md#stacktrace) | Display the full stacktrace of the last error |

## Reference

### Interactive Commands

The action prompt provides many features to guide you during operation.

| Feature | How to use it |
|---|---|
| **Interactive help** | Type `help` at the action prompt. |
| **Review available commands** | Commands that cannot be used without creating other resources first are tagged with `*` in the output of the `help` command. |
| **Command completion** | Hit the `<tab>` key at any time to get assistance or to complete partially-entered commands. |
| **Cancel input** | Type `<Ctrl-C>` before entering a command to return to an empty action prompt. |
| **Syntax indication** | Invalid commands are highlighted as you type. |
| **Clear the display** | Type `<Ctrl-L>` at any time. |
| **Show command history** | Type `history` at the action prompt. |
| **Previous commands** | Navigate previous commands using the up and down arrows, and use standard emacs shortcuts. |
| **Interactive or scripted operation** | You can interact with the command line interface directly, or send it commands on standard input to incorporate it into shell scripts. |
